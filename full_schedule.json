However, when deploying JVM-based services, the warmup time of JIT compilation can be a limitation on the effectiveness of this technique.\r\n\r\nOne approach to solving this problem is using native images, where the service is statically compiled using an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler.  Although this does reduce startup time and footprint, it does so at the cost of overall performance.\r\n\r\nA new project has been proposed and accepted into OpenJDK called CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint).  The goal is to research the co-ordination of Java programs with mechanisms to checkpoint (snapshot) a running application.  Restoring from the snapshot could solve some of the problems with the startup and warmup times, especially in microservices.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we\u2019ll look at the main challenges for such a project, potential solutions and the results from a proof-of-concept implementation.\r\n","persons":[{"id":2526,"full_public_name":"Simon RItter","abstract":"I joined Sun Microsystems in February 1996, and have followed Java throughout its lifetime at Sun then Oracle and now Azul Systems.","twitter_name":"speakjava","avatar_path":"/system/avatars/2526/large/SimonRitter-181023-3.png?1585751745"}]},{"id":6825,"date":"2022-04-13T14:20:00-04:00","start":"14:20","duration":"01:00","room":"Java Platform","title":"Simple tweaks to get the most out of your JVM","track":"Java Platform","type":"lecture","abstract":"This talk will go through all the different JVM options and give you some easy and simple advice on how to get the most out of your JVM to save not only money but also energy on the cloud.","persons":[{"id":1583,"full_public_name":"Jamie Lee Coleman","abstract":"Jamie is a software developer and Advocate for Open Liberty, MicroProfile and Kabanero based at IBM\u2019s R&D Laboratory in Hursley, UK.

With the popularity of cloud environments, the scalability required by new architectures and the need to support more load efficiently, there has been an increase in attention that we need to pay to concurrency and efficiency.\r\n\r\nOne strategy to achieve that efficiency consists of distributing the modules of your application in several different smaller components running concurrently. But one of the problems that arise from such distribution of running modules comes when you need to send a request (and wait for the response) to several different modules. How do you design that request(s)-response(s) to be as efficient as possible?\r\n\r\nCompletable futures were introduced in Java 8, and they are a powerful mechanism to add concurrency (not parallelism) to your application logic, and it may be handy when dealing with multiple queries to different systems.\r\n\r\nIf you are a developer, you may make your code more performant by using CompletableFutures where it makes sense.\r\n\r\nIf you are a library developer, it may be a good thing to offer an API that returns CompletableFutures so that your users will be able to benefit from it.","persons":[{"id":2709,"full_public_name":"David G\u00f3mez Garc\u00eda","abstract":"David has been working in Software development for more than 20 years, taking part in projects for different projects in sectors like Banking, Defense, Services & Retail, Maritime and ground transport.
