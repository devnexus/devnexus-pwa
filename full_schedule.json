But why should I scare you into writing better websites when I could entice you with the promise of dramatically better SEO, dramatically better mobile support, and dramatically better performance by simply using the web platform as it was designed and intended to be used?\r\n\r\nIn this keynote, Scott Davis (Web Architect and Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) gives you simple, practical, actionable advice on how to improve the Accessibility of your website. You'll also hear plenty of real world case studies of companies that get web accessibility right, and plenty more of companies that don't.  \r\n\r\nIf you think this advice doesn't apply to you, WebAIM analyzed the top 1 million websites in 2019 and found that 98% of them had significant Accessibility issues. On average, there were 60 a11y errors per homepage, or 1 error for every 13 HTML elements on the page. And if you think your web framework might help you out of this bind, React-based websites had, on average, 10% more Accessibility errors; Angular-based websites had 20% more Accessibility errors; Vue-based websites had 25% more a11y errors.\r\n\r\nSo, unless you are among the 2% who don't have significant website Accessibility issues, you might actually learn something.

There has to be a way we can develop services more quickly and have confidence they will work in production!\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will learn about the goals and processes behind contract driven development and how they resolve a lot of pain points around developing in a microservices/cloud world. Once we have the underlying principles figured out, we will switch to the practical and look at using Spring Cloud Contract to write contracts. Spring Cloud Contract offers several approaches for writing contracts and we will cover them so your organization can choose which would be the best fit.
