With Kubernetes Akka finally has a node management system. Akka Cluster has been designed to gracefully handle nodes leaving and joining a running cluster while continuing to run. Kubernetes adds and removes nodes as needed to increase capacity or to recover from failures. In effect, there is a perfect symbiosis between Akka Cluster and Kubernetes.

Every year there are new tools, new technologies and new articles that claim Java is dead, or not relevant, or being imminently replaced, and yet Java is still as relevant to modern businesses as it was a decade ago. The temptation is to look at Java middleware from the mid-2000s and dismiss in light of the shift into cloud based development and deployment practices and say \"it isn't relevant\". However Java middleware of the late 2010s is very different, more efficient and more cloud ready than ever.\r\n\r\nIn modern cloud environments you need runtimes that start and stop quickly, use a low memory footprint, scale well for high throughput and provide just enough runtime to support your application needs. Traditional Java application servers don't do this, but the traditional application server has been replaced by more efficient and effective frameworks that enable you to more quickly build and deploy your applications while using existing APIs that have been proven at building complex and reliable applications. Open Liberty is one such project, available under the Eclipse Public License it provides a fast, efficient and scalable foundation for building modern applications.\r\n\r\nIn this session Alasdair Nottingham, the Open Liberty lead, will guide you through the Open Liberty project and how to use it to build modern applications using Java EE, Eclipse MicroProfile or Spring that can be easily deployed into cloud platforms like Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n","persons":[{"id":917,"full_public_name":"Alasdair Nottingham","abstract":"","twitter_name":"nottycode","avatar_path":"/system/avatars/917/large/alasdai.jpeg?1549662243"}]},{"id":3317,"date":"2019-03-08T13:20:00-05:00","start":"13:20","duration":"00:40","room":"Unobtanium","title":"Advancing AI ubiquity in the enterprise IoT networks","track":"Unobtanium","type":"lecture","abstract":"This talk will focus on Edge Processing by taking advantage of deep learning capabilities of IoT devices as a cluster, by moving away from processing simple sensory data to deriving meaningful reasoning using Java.
